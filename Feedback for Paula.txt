Feedback on Paula's code:

- Ordered, clean and clear.
- Great use of Dictionary Comprehensions
- Elegant avoidance of while loops while still mantaining code robustness to user input. (Bravisimo)
- The fact that there is both a function and a list called wordlenght is a bit confusing.
- The fact that the dictionary_player_progress is constructed in 2 steps could maybe be shortened, 
but to be completely honest I wouldn't know how to simplify that either, so it's a good solution.
- I think in cell 7 you could have reused the same code as inside the function wordlenght().
Like using word_choice_dict to build player progress maybe?
- I think with word_progress_dict you are going in the right direction.
- In complex loops (like the one during the playing option that goes for ever word index and letter in the word_choice dict items)
try commenting more so that the step by step is clearer.
- The automatically setting the input to lower case so you dont have to have more conditions for handling user input is brilliant!
- The structure of the playing function is really really good and solid.
- The other file where the cpu chooses is perfectly clear and a great example of what to package in a module to then import.
