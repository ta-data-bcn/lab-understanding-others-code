Blackjack Game - Pol


Workflow:

-Introduction of the Game
-Structure of functions that build the game
-Code that runs the game


Ways of THinking:

-Really liked the way structured the game, so you can play multiple rounds with the updates of your wallet.
-How a tuple is assigned to the Ace


Best Practices:

-Good example of how usefull are functions
-Interaction between user and game, really liked how it was displayed


Ways to improve:

-Try to give one order to one function, having lots of code within a function may cause the reader to get confused
-Could have the code that actually runs the game in a seperate file
