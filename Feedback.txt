Best Practices:

- Code well explained through comments. Step by step clarifications and easy to follow.

- Good display of the instructions at the beginning of the game.

- Good "interface" to see where the empty boxes and the boxes filled by the user
(as visual as a Jupyter Notebook without any library may get)

- Code well structured and functional, very "Pythonic". 


Ways of thinking/New methods:

- Really well-thought the use of sets and the condition "issubset".







Possible improvements:

- Would bee useful to include a try/except condition when introducing the box positions.

- Maximum rounds and actual round are stored as variables and updated every time, but I can't see when they are used
throughout the game.

- There is an small typo: a small difference ("!") between the variables in 'winners_list' and the assignation done at the end
of the code for the variable "the_winner", preventing the "while" loop to finish.
