workflow:
1. Define game rules(name, lvl) inside a function
2. print the function
3. While playing function

Doubts on workflow:
>>No doubts



Nice things on workflow:
>>Readme file brief and concise, nice to read and easy to understand
>>Straight forward syntax


Possible improvements:
>>Add explanation in each step
>>Fragment each part of the game for functionalities
>>In "guesses part":
	.Bug found - If not entering an integer the game breaks.
	.Proposal: Add a Try-Except line.

	while guesses <= 5:
		try:
    			player_number = int(input("Guess: "))
    			if player_number == number:
        			print("Congratulations! You guessed the number!")
        			break
    			elif player_number < number:
        			guesses += 1
        			print("Too low")
    			elif player_number > number:
        			guesses += 1
        			print("Too high")
    			if guesses == 5:
        			print("Sorry, you lost the game.")
        			break
		except ValueError:
			print('I want a number!')
			<return the beginning of the function>


>>In "While playing function" the function could be improved as:
