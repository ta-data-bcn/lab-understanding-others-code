Comments for Cristina's project: Hangman

Overall comments:
- Very clear code, easy to understand thanks to notations
- Great logic when structuring the game!!

Possible improvements:
- Name variables in a way they can be better understood (e.g. "list_movie" and "list_guesses" instead of "list1" and "list2"

Possible future additions to the game:
- Add more words from database
- Add possibility to play more rounds, and keep track of points?
- Add drawing of hangman
- Include limitations and error handling when asking the user for inputs (e.g.: allow only letters not already input)
